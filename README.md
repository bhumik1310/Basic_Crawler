# Basic_Crawler
A basic JS crawler that is subdivided into two scripts.
- "Get_links" takes in a link and outputs all the sub-links in the domain to ./storage/key-value-stores/OUTPUT.csv (Remove the links you do not want to crawl)
- "Crawl-Links" reads the CSV created from the folder itself , crawls all links present in the CSV one by one.
